# NextFolio

A portfolio site that runs its own blog pipeline. It drafts articles with selectable AI models, checks them for accuracy, researches keywords, and measures what ranks, all from an admin dashboard wired to live Google data.

## Intention

Publishing regularly is easy. Publishing accurately is not. This project automates the draft but keeps verification human: every article is reviewed claim by claim before it ships, and Search Console data decides what to write next instead of guesswork. It is built to be forked. Strip the personal content and the same pipeline runs any blog.

## What you get

**If you write content**, at `/admin`:

- New post editor with rich text, cover image upload, and image-prompt generation.
- Article review: AI checks accuracy with web search, you apply fixes per field. Nothing changes until you approve it.
- Keywords page (`/admin/keywords`): real search volume, competition, and bid ranges from Google Ads. Pick a keyword, generate a draft from it, and the row tracks whether it is written.
- Search Console dashboard (`/admin/search-console`): clicks, impressions, CTR, and position with compare mode, index status per post, and AI analysis with priorities and quick wins.
- Settings (`/admin/settings`) and Prompts (`/admin/prompts`): change AI models and rewrite the generation, review, and analysis prompts without touching code.

**If you build software**, in the code:

- Next.js 16 App Router with React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS v4, Prisma 5 on Supabase Postgres.
- One `callModel` facade over three AI endpoint families (chat, responses, messages), so every catalog model is selectable.
- Typed settings store with zod validation, AES-256-GCM encryption for stored tokens, and additive-only migrations that are safe to deploy against a shared database.
- Google OAuth with PKCE and refresh-token rotation, Search Console and Keyword Planner REST clients with typed errors, Auth.js credentials auth, Vercel Blob uploads, and a cron-driven generation pipeline.

**If you own the site**: the dashboard answers what to write next from your own search data, with no SEO tool subscription for the basics.

## Reuse

MIT licensed. Use it as a portfolio, a blog engine, an AI writing pipeline, or a Search Console plus Keyword Planner admin. Forks commonly keep `src/app/lib`, `src/app/admin`, and `prisma/` and replace `src/data` and `src/components` with their own content.

## Setup

Requires Node.js 20.9 or newer, a PostgreSQL database, and optionally a Google Cloud project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dew97-tech/NextFolio.git
cd NextFolio
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env` (table below), then migrate and run:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. There is no default account. While the user table is empty, the first sign-in creates the admin only when the credentials match `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Clear `ADMIN_PASSWORD` afterwards.

Then, in `/admin/settings`: choose AI models, connect the Google account, pick the Search Console property, and add the Keyword Planner customer ID.
